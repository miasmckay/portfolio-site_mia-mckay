            <h4>What is WellWise?</h4>
            <p> WellWise is an education app that enables users to discover credible health content featuring real
                testimonials
                from individuals who have transformed their health, advice from experts, and articles to stay informed
                on the latest trends and evidence-based insights. The app safely secures user’s health data to track
                their progress with industry-standard security and curates personalized supplements and natural health
                solutions based on the user’s needs and goals.</p>
            <h4> My Role</h4>
            <p> UX Designer</p>
            <h4> Project Duration</h4>
            <p> March-December 2024</p>
            <h4> The Problem</h4>
            <p>In today’s fast-paced world, many individuals are seeking effective ways to improve their health and
                wellness, but often find themselves overwhelmed by the abundance of information and lack of personalized
                guidance. Traditional medical approaches frequently emphasize pharmaceutical solutions, which may not
                address the root causes of health issues or align with individuals' preferences for natural, holistic
                methods.</p>
            <h4> Objective</h4>
            <p> By providing an educational health hub with credible information and personalized natural health
                solutions that address the challenges of online information overload, individuals can take better care
                of their physical and mental health naturally.</p>
            <h3> Design Process</h3>
            <h4> Discover</h4>
            <p> In the discovery phase, I focused on understanding the problem and gathering insights about users and
                the competitive landscape:
                User Surveys: Gathered attitudinal data to understand user perceptions, behaviors, and needs at scale.
                User Interviews: Collected qualitative insights to dive deeper into user motivations and pain points.
                Competitive Analysis: Examined existing health apps and natural health education platforms to understand
                market gaps, strengths, and opportunities.
                This stage helped me empathize with users and set a foundation for further exploration.</p>
            <h4>Define</h4>
            <p> Here, I synthesized the research findings to clearly articulate user needs and define the problem:
                Affinity Mapping: Organized and categorized qualitative and quantitative data into patterns, helping
                identify common themes and insights.
                User Personas: Created detailed personas to humanize your target users, providing a clear understanding
                of their goals, frustrations, and behaviors. </p>

            </picture>
            <h4>Ideate</h4>
            <p>In the ideation phase, I explored potential solutions to address user needs:
                Brainstorming and Sketching: I first generated a variety of ideas for the app.
                User Journey Maps: I mapped out the user experience across different touchpoints to understand user
                emotions, pain points, and opportunities.
                User Flows: I designed user flows to illustrate how users would navigate through the app to achieve
                specific tasks.
                Site Maps: I created a site map to structure the app and ensure intuitive navigation.</p>

            </picture>
            <h4>Design</h4>
            <p> Next, I translated my ideas into hand drawn sketched and iterated on potential solutions:
                Developed low and mid-fidelity wireframes for layout and basic functionality.
                From there, I created high-fidelity prototypes with detailed design systems for usability and visual
                appeal. </p>

            </picture>

            <h4>Test</h4>
            <p> I conducted usability testing to validate my designs and identify areas for improvement. Testing ensured
                that my solution addressed user needs effectively.
                I collected feedback through methods like usability tests and preference tests.
                Analyzed user responses to pinpoint pain points or friction in the design, organizing the data with
                methods like the rainbow spreadsheet. </p>
            <h4>Refine</h4>
            <p>Based on testing feedback, I refined my design to enhance usability, functionality, and user
                satisfaction:
                I iterated my wireframes or prototypes to fix issues and incorporate insights from usability testing.
                I then polished my designs to ensure it aligned with user expectations and business goals.</p>
